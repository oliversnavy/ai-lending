"""
TimeAwarenessMiddleware — injects wall-clock budget messages before model calls.

The agent has no intrinsic sense of elapsed time. Without reminders, it
over-invests in model iteration and runs out of context before saving its
deliverable (risk_model.pkl + pricing_policy.py). This middleware injects a
brief HumanMessage at 50%, 75%, and 90% of the episode budget so the agent
can prioritise accordingly.

At 90%+ with can_jump_to=["end"], it can also hard-terminate if needed
(currently just warns — flip exit_on_expiry=True to enable hard stop).

Deliberately does not ask the agent to compute/report final metrics under time
pressure — that combination (time pressure + "just write a number") is what
produced episode_0005's fabricated result. pnl/c_stat/etc. are computed
independently from the saved artifacts by agent/evaluator/evaluate_episode.py.
