        Consult the senior advisor on a strategic question.

        Consult at the START (plan review), at key DECISION POINTS (model choice,
        pricing strategy), when STUCK (poor P&L, unclear cause), and at the END
        (results review). Aim for 2–4 consultations per episode. Keep queries specific.

        Args:
            context:  Brief summary of what you\'ve done so far and any relevant results.
            question: The specific question or decision you need guidance on.

        Returns:
